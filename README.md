##Hangman Terminal Version : Java##
---
This is a Hangman game written in Java and running on a terminal.  
The author uses Maven as a project management tool for the development.  
The game allows the user to select a list of words that s/he would like to play.  

Available word list files include:

* words.txt
* bigwordslist.txt
* unixwords.txt
 
The player will first select the word list file to play.  Then, just like a class Hangman game, the user will guess the letter as s/he tries to guess the word.  There are some letter graphics that shows the status of the game.  After each game, the score report will show up to the user. 

The game was designed using an Object-oriented approach and has a utility class that comprise useful static methods to be used for other purposes in other classes.

Usage:
> java -jar hangman-2.0.jar
